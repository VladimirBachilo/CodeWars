CodeWar. CodeWar never changes. </br>
But my programming level does. And here's how.


## Description

These are up-to-date solutions that I submited on Codewars. And it's pretty much "work in progress", since I follow a very famous quote: </br>
> By continuously improving the design of code, we make it easier and easier to work with. </br>
> This is in sharp contrast to what typically happens: little refactoring and a great deal of attention paid to expediently adding new features.</br>
> If you get into the hygienic habit of refactoring continuously, you'll find that it is easier to extend and maintain code.</br>
> - Joshua Kerievsky, *Refactoring to Patterns*</br>

</br>
I mean it.</br>
Seriously.
