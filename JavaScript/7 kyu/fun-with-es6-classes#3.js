  * TODO: Define the following classes.
  * I. Cuboid
  * The object constructor for the class Cuboid should receive exactly
  * three arguments in the following order: length, width, height and store
  * these three values in this.length, this.width and this.height respectively.
  * The class Cuboid should then have a getter surfaceArea which returns
  * the surface area of the cuboid and a getter volume which returns
  * the volume of the cuboid.
  * II. Cube
  * class Cube is a subclass of class Cuboid. The constructor function of
  * Cube should receive one argument only, its length, and use that value
  * passed in to set this.length, this.width and this.height.
